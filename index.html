          <p><span class="emphasis">Congratulations!</span> You have entered the world of parenthood. Whether you're
            expecting
            your first baby or bringing home
            your second set of triplets, one thing will have already become obvious to you: everyone and their
            grandmother
            has an
            opinion on how you should be raising your baby/babies.</p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Advice is great, right?</span> It's given with the best intentions, and some of it
            is
            really quite useful! That is
            unless it just doesn't sit right with you. Or it makes you feel like maybe you're not doing this whole
            parenting
            thing “right". Or if it makes you feel completely unprepared!</p>
          <p>The problem with this abundance of advice is that Western culture doesn't always treat parents or babies as
            individuals with their own unique personalities, appetites or sleep-needs. Prescriptive schedules and “one
            size
            fits all" approaches to parenting may work for a small percentage of families, but does that mean it's right
            for
            you? And if it's not, what does that mean?</p>
          <p class="quote">
            It means that you deserve evidence based, holistic support that is tailored to your family's individual
            needs, goals and boundaries
          </p>
          <p><span class="emphasis">Families and their needs come in all shapes and sizes.</span> Some may need support
            in
            optimising sleep, while others have
            feeding concerns. You may be looking for remote support for help with a particular issue, or you may have
            decided that
            in-home help would better suit your needs.</p>
          <p class="emphasis">
            I provide holistic, research-backed advice for parents experiencing anxieties or obstacles. I do not promise
            miracle
            cures, but work with each family's individual needs and circumstances to create solutions to feeding,
            sleeping
            and
            care issues. This could include remote assistance, night nannying, day nannying or 24/5 in-home support. My
            temporary bookings can be as flexible as your needs require, from a single day or night up to 3 months
            24/5
            care.</p>

                Between Aunt Hilda's panic over the lack of a feeding schedule, and the myriad of books promising to get
                your baby to “sleep through the night" and “learn independence”, <span class="emphasis">it is important
                  to know that not all
                  advice was created equal.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                While there are books, apps, and an abundance of literature out there, the expert on your baby whose
                opinion trumps the
                lot is yours.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="emphasis">No author has written a book specifically about your baby.</span> They do not
                know their temperament, individual sleep needs, or appetite. I am not saying that that there are no good
                parenting resources out there - there are! However, my goal is to empower you as a parent to trust your
                own instinctive, intuitive expertise by getting to know your baby.
              </p>
              <p>
                By focusing on your baby, learning to read their cues, holding, feeding, washing, playing with,
                massaging and getting to know them, you will learn how to respond to their needs intuitively. You will
                build your own confidence, and be more at ease with this new little person or little people in your
                life. You will build a stronger, healthier relationship by reading and responding to your baby's cues
                than you ever could by trying to program them through an app or a book written by a “childcare expert”.

                <span class="emphasis">"Don't hold the baby so much, you're going to spoil him!".</span> I want you to
                know that this joyless idea is in no way
                evidence-based. Science is on your side. It is fundamentally impossible to spoil a baby.
              </p>
              <p>This is an idea that is years out of date and has served as a real obstacle for parents torn between
                bonding with their
                babies and wanting to parent “correctly". There are countless ideas that stem from avoiding spoiling a
                baby, some of
                which you have probably already heard, and none of which are backed up by scientific evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are
                some examples:

              <ul class="emphasis">
                <li>"Now that your baby is a certain weight, they should be sleeping through the night"

                <li>"Now that your baby is a certain age, they should be sleeping through the night"
                </li>
                <li>"Don't pick up your baby when they cry, they're controlling you"
                </li>
                <li>"You need to teach your baby to self-soothe"
                </li>
                <li>"You're STILL breastfeeding? That can't be healthy"
                </li>
                <li>"You need to let your breasts fill up before you feed again"
                </li>
                <li>"If you let your baby sleep in your bed, you'll never get them out"
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although these commonly-heard challenges are meant to be helpful, they are outdated, misguided, and
                most importantly not evidence-based. Let this knowledge empower you to smile, politely nod along, and
                then go with your gut.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span class="emphasis">
                  Just because a baby reaches a certain weight or age does not automatically make it appropriate to
                  assume they are
                  ready to sleep through the night.
                </span> Reaching a certain age/weight does not cause an automatic gear-change in unique
                temperament, sleep-needs or appetite. Sure, if your gut tells you that their temperament will tolerate a
                gentle nudge in
                that direction, use your intuition and don't be pushed past any boundaries you are not comfortable
                crossing.

                As for advice on breastfeeding, most of us are more familiar with generations of bottle feeding. Bottle
                feeding is a
                completely different ball game to breastfeeding. It is common to hear advice for bottle feeding applied
                to
                breastfeeding, which is often flawed and non-compatible. By getting familiar with breastfeeding norms,
                you will be more
                confident in dismissing misguided advice.

                sleeping through the
                night, whether they are a good eater, and if they are on a schedule. Parenting “success" is too often
                determined by how
                little your baby seems to require your input. This is a relatively new (and unhealthy) way of thinking.

                  humans are actually animals.</span> More
                specifically, mammals. That means, among other things, that nature has designed us with specific
                intentions in mind,
                that are controlled through instincts, hormones, reflexes etc. For example, we are designed to be
                distressed by a baby's
                cry so that we quickly respond - it is a survival mechanism. Newborns have short, mostly shallow sleep
                cycles so they
                can be easily roused, which acts as a built-in safety feature.

                In her excellent book "Breastfeeding Made Simple - Seven Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers", Nancy
                Morhbacher IBCLC, FILCA explains that many of our cultural beliefs run counter to our biological norms.
                In recent generations western
                culture has promoted baby care styles that are more appropriate for Nest Mammals. Strollers, feeding
                schedules, and sleep training can detune you to your baby's unique personality, feeding rhythms and
                sleeping patterns.

                        Sleep is always a hot topic for parents. When you are in the midst and mists of sleep
                        deprivation, it
                        can be tempting to use controversial and sometimes-dangerous sleep training methods that offer
                        "miracle
                        results". Your need for sleep is very real. Night time support can grant you the sleep you
                        crave, safe
                        in the knowledge that your baby is being cared for while you dream.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If breastfeeding, baby can be brought to you during the night for feeds. Afterwards, baby is
                        taken back
                        to the nursery and settled. If bottle feeding, I take care of all night feeds. All equipment is
                        left
                        cleaned and sterilised for the day ahead.

                        Nightshift bookings last a minimum of 8 hours. Typically a night shift will end at an agreed
                        time
                        (usually 6am or 7am,
                        although this is flexible) however, depending on availability parents may wish to sleep until
                        they wake
                        up naturally.

                        Troubleshooting appointments are ideal for parents or carers who are facing challenges or are
                        confused by conflicting advice that doesn't sit right with how they want to care for their
                        babies. This may involve simply voicing your concerns, deep-diving a particular topic, or
                        helping you
                        get in touch with the right care providers
                        if you are experiencing feeding issues that require specialist attention. The most common areas
                        of troubleshooting are
                        feeding and sleep.

                        There are many misconceptions about what breastfeeding entails, as bottle feeding has been so
                        prevalent in recent
                        generations. Breastfeeding and bottle feeding are two very different ball-games, but problems
                        have arisen when we try to
                        apply bottle feeding techniques to breastfeeding.

                        My holistic approach to sleep takes in a variety of factors unique to your family's dynamic. I
                        then create a plan
                        designed to optimise sleep, without pushing for developmentally inappropriate outcomes.

                      <p>
                        Night waking is a normal, protective part of infant sleep. However, there are many things that
                        can be done to optimise
                        infant sleep without leaving babies to cry alone. This can be helpful for newborns, older babies
                        and even toddlers.
                        None of my coaching involves letting a baby cry alone for any ammount of time.

                Travelling with a newborn looks very different to travelling child-free. Jet-lag combined with existing

                nanny,
                but will also
                extend my hours to accommodate activities during the day.

                          One of my sons suffers from Febrile convulsions and the other has asthma. Kirsty and my
                          husband
                          were taking care of the
                          twins when William had his first convulsion. Kirsty was incredibly clear headed and again
                          immediately took charge. By
                          the time I had returned from the supermarket (!) Kirsty was on the phone to 999 and was taking
                          instructions, with our
                          other son (obviously distressed) on her hip.
                          There have been a number of similar incidents where Kirsty has used her sense and initiative
                          to
                          deal with the situation
                          in hand, without distressing and panicking. She is without a doubt the person you would want
                          by
                          your side in a crisis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          She has such a wonderful way with children. Engaging at their level but very clear with
                          discipline.
                          Kirsty has continued to be involved in our family, providing care for our boys, whether for a
                          night babysitting or a 48
                          hr sleep-over, having sole charge while we were away from the family home.

                        <p>I'm so thankful for the advice you gave us when Clara was younger! I find it much easier to
                          get
                          her to sleep after
                          following your advice about having a routine and sleep cues. She does still wake in the
                          night but
                          again, it's far easier
                          to get her back to sleep knowing the cues she responds to. The best ones for us were the
                          introduction of a safe comfort
                          toy to make it easier to transfer her in to her cot and the same sounds/songs to associate
                          with
                          sleep. It was also
                          really great to know that you supported breastfeeding past the newborn stage and safe
                          co-sleeping
                          as a lot of the
                          "advice" I received elsewhere was to stop breastfeeding her and leave her in her cot to cry.

                          for a good night's

                        <p>Kirsty came to work with us while when our twin daughters were seven weeks old. Our daughters
                          were premature, and at the
                          time Kirsty joined us one of our daughters was home while the other was still in the Special
                          Care
                          Baby Unit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Having Kirsty with us at at that time was invaluable: She was very supportive and used her
                          initiative to ensure the time
                          we spent with our daughter in the hospital went as smoothly as possible by being mindfull of
                          what
                          we needed to bring
                          with us to the hospital each day and minding our daughter in the parents room while me and my
                          husband spent time in the
                          SCBU (as there is a two person maximum policy).
                          Kirsty's extensive knowledge of breastfeeding was hugely beneficial: She was able to advise on
                          positioning and
                          attachment, milk supply and even helped me to tandem feed both girls in the SCBU!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          It was reassuring to me that Kirsty and I shared the same views on gentle sleep training:
                          Kirsty
                          was very keen to work
                          with me in making the nursery a calm and relaxing area for the babies. I co-slept with my
                          daughter
                          in the nursery on my
                          own until I had both girls home, when Kirsty moved into the nursery with me and looked after
                          my
                          daughter who could only
                          be bottle fed EBM, while I looked after my daughter who was breastfeeding on demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I cant express how grateful I am that Kirsty was there to help me through the night: She
                          ensured
                          all pumping equipment,
                          bottles and dummies were sterilized, that feeds were made up in advance, changed nappies, fed,
                          burped and settled the
                          babies and even made sure I was eating and drinking enough to keep going and protect my milk
                          supply. She was also able
                          to set out a routine for the following maternity nanny that was tailored to our families
                          needs.
                          Kirsty is well read, caring and organised. She uses her initiative and has a really lovely way
                          with children. Her
                          patience and positive attitude has been invaluable.

                          Kirsty is undoubtedly one of the most genuine, hard working, kindest people I have had the
                          pleasure of not only
                          employing, but building a friendship with. Kirsty would go above and beyond her line of duty
                          on a
                          day to day basis and
                          it was evident through this that she genuinely cared about her work and my son that she was
                          looking after. I trusted her
                          completely with my newborn and was beyond grateful for her assistance and knowledge. She
                          carried a
                          perfect balance
                          between professionalism and personal interaction and was always able to read a room in terms
                          of
                          what was appropriate and
                          when.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          She is extremely thorough with her work and never leaves a stone unturned - she is what some
                          would
                          call a
                          perfectionist.
                          It is evident to anyone meeting Kirsty that she is a special and kind person who loves to help
                          and
                          support anyone around
                          her. She always does the right thing and carries very high morals with her. She is funny,
                          quirky
                          and smart. She also has
                          an incredible aptitude for caring for babies. It is apparent that it is a true passion of
                          hers.
                          She is a natural!

                          I found Kirsty to be punctual, extremely reliable, good company and she has a great sense of
                          humour.
                          My twins are now six months, four months corrected age. Kirsty helped with changing, feeding,
                          bathing and the girls
                          sleep routine. During her time with me we focused on re addressing the balance between
                          combination
                          feeding and breast
                          feeding, the bias had slipped towards more formula feeding and my milk supply was decreasing.
                          Kirsty enabled me to take
                          the much needed rest and gave me the support I needed in order for me prioritise expressing
                          and
                          feeding.
                          During Kirsty's stay she had sole charge of the girls, handling the night feeds.

                          Like any other new parents we were so worried about hiring a nanny and thought about all the
                          what-if scenarios, until we
                          met Kirsty. I felt so at ease on the first day. Kirsty demonstrated a wide range of knowledge
                          about babies and you can
                          definitely tell that she's passionate about them and is constantly equipping herself through
                          studying despite her
                          extensive experience and qualifications.

                          Kirsty has a calming, caring, soothing and comforting nature, not only with babies but also
                          the
                          parents. In the past
                          five months, I did not have one doubt about her ability. On the days and nights that she's
                          here

                          problems going out and sleeping through the whole night. Kirsty documents everything that
                          happened
                          so you felt like you
                          were there too. Oh! And she sent really nice and cute pictures!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Our family is from the United States and Hong Kong and sometimes we have different cultural
                          practice. Kirsty is very
                          respectful, she has no problems telling you what she thinks is best for the baby but she'd
                          also
                          totally understand and
                          respect your wishes. My mum doesn't speak much English and Kirsty somehow still manage to
                          communicate with her and my
                          mum loves her.
                          We've tried one other nanny while Kirsty was not available, honestly she doesn't even come
                          close
                          to Kirsty! At the end of
                          the day, the most important thing is that I TRUST Kirsty with my baby boy.

                  Families come in all shapes and sizes. Some may need support in optimising sleep, while others have
                  feeding concerns.
                  You may be looking for remote support for help with a particular issue, or you may have decided that
                  in-home help would
                  better suit your needs.
                </p>
                <p>My goal is to care for you and your family in a way that is bespoke to you. We can talk about any
                  difficulties you may be having and see if I can help.</p>
                <p>
                  Feel free to get in touch to see how we can make this special time as enjoyable as possible.
